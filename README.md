Troubleshoot
=========

1. Weird original photos if (Settings > Photos & Camera > Keep Normal Photo) is ON
  Disable it does fix this problem, My prediction about this is Apple's Camera app can't handle HDR photo capturing in Front Camera.
  I don't serious about this because you can just fix that like i said above.
